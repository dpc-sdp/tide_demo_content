        <p>The Trades Fit - Young Women in Trades and Tech is an inaugural expo hosted by the Department of Education and Training. The expo showcases employment options within the trades and tech industries, with interactive displays set up for students to experience what these careers could be.</p>

        <p>The expo will introduce female students* in years 9 and 10 to career pathways in traditionally male dominated industries, and provide information about how they can pursue exciting career opportunities in these fields.</p>

        <p>Leading the activity for National Careers Week, The Trades Fit lets young women connect with employers, key industry organisations and supporters of gender equity, that are helping women step into these fields.</p>

        <p>Students will hear from trade and tech representatives from fields including building and construction, electrical engineering, plumbing, automotive, transport and logistics, mining, agriculture and horticulture, aviation, marine, and many more.</p>

        <p>Students will be able to engage with these career pathways through hands-on experiences, tech displays, information sessions, panel discussions, and guest speakers.</p>

        <p>We invite teachers to book for their students so they can get involved and immerse themselves in all things trades and tech.</p>

        <p>All Victorian secondary schools have the opportunity to include up to 20 female students* across years 9 and 10 to attend.</p>

        <p>There'll be four sessions across two days. Each school can attend only one of the sessions.</p>

        <p>Book now as spaces are limited.</p>
