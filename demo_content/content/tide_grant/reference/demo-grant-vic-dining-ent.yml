                                           <p>If you have submitted a claim prior to the program closing then we are still processing your application.</p>

                                           <p>People who submitted valid claims before the program closed will still receive their cash back.</p>
                                           
                                           <p>You can <a href="https://dining-and-entertainment.business.vic.gov.au/track">track your claim </a>using your claim ID.</p>

                                           <p>No, the program is closed and we are no longer accepting new claims.</p>
                                           
                                           <p><strong>How much funding was available to claim back?</strong></p>
                                           
                                           <p>A total of $25 million was available for customers to claim cash back under the Victorian Dining and Entertainment Program.</p>

                                           <p>In two weeks, the program put $25 million back into the pockets of customers and boosted tens of thousands of hard-working businesses across Victoria.</p>
                                           
                                           <p>Almost 65 per cent of people who made a claim said they made their purchase because of the program or spent more than they otherwise would have.</p>
                                           
                                           <p><strong>Who is administering the program?</strong></p>
                                           
                                           <p>The program is being administered by the Department of Jobs, Precincts and Regions and WAIVPAY Ltd.</p>
                                           
                                           <p>WAIVPAY is an Australian-based software company that provides gifting, loyalty, rewards and digital payment solutions.</p>
                                           
                                           <p><strong>I have submitted my claim but haven’t yet heard if it’s been approved. Do I need to resubmit my claim?</strong></p>
                                           
                                           <p>If you have already made a claim and received a claim ID number by email, please be assured that your claim and query will be processed as soon as possible. There is no need to resubmit your claim.</p>
                                           
                                           <p><strong>I’ve received my cash back but it is less than 25 per cent of my total purchase. Why has this happened?</strong></p>
                                           
                                           <p>It is likely you have reached your combined cash back cap of $125 on dining and entertainment experiences under the program. If you are nearing your cash back cap and submit an eligible claim, you will receive the remaining amount to reach $125.</p>
                                           
                                           <p>If a cash back payment is capped, the same proof of purchase cannot be resubmitted by another individual to claim the full or remaining amount.</p>
                                           
                                           <p>If you believe you haven’t reached your combined cash back cap of $125, please <a href="https://dining-and-entertainment.business.vic.gov.au/contact">contact WAIVPAY</a> for more information. You can <a href="https://dining-and-entertainment.business.vic.gov.au/contact">submit a request online</a> or contact us by calling 1300 969 930.</p>
                                           
                                           <p><strong>I’ve lost my proof of purchase. Can I still make a claim?</strong></p>
                                           
                                           <p>No. A tax invoice or proof of purchase is required to make a claim. Please ensure you retain all your receipts to submit your claim. Consider contacting the hospitality or entertainment venue to request a copy of the tax invoice.</p>
                                           
                                           <p>We advise you to keep your tax invoice or proof of purchase until your claim outcome is confirmed by email.</p>

                                           <p>If your claim was rejected, the most likely reasons are the experience is not eligible or your tax invoice or proof of purchase did not contain all the required information.</p>
