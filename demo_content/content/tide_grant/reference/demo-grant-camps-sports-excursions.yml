                                        	<li>create a ‘family credit’ for the costs already paid. The credit can then be used towards other school expenses.</li>
                                        	<li>Where a family credit is created, the school and family can agree for the credit to be applied to other expenses for the student. The school will need to be able to demonstrate via the family account statement that the CSEF payment was utilised towards camps, sports and excursion expenses for the benefit of the eligible student. It is up to the school whether they agree to this option.</li>
